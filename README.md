# Puppet Syntax Checkers

All the scripts were taken from [drwhal/puppet-git-hooks](https://github.com/drwahl/puppet-git-hooks) with almost no changes.

## Current supported pre-receive (server side) checks

* Puppet manifest syntax
* ERB and EPP template syntax
* Ruby syntax
* Puppet-lint
* YAML and JSON (hieradata) syntax
* Puppetfile syntax

## Usage

Validate Puppet code on the version control server with a pre-receive git hook.

### BitBucket

- Install the required gems in the BitBucket server
- Clone this project and ensure the scripts have execution permissions
- Enforce the main script, puppet_syntax_checkers.sh at the pre-receive git stage

I use the plugin [external hooks](https://marketplace.atlassian.com/plugins/com.ngs.stash.externalhooks.external-hooks/server/overview)
